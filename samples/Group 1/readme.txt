The next directory contains the digitized samples from the main experiment 1. 

Samples were digitized with Heidelberg Linoscan 2650 scanner with software
SilverFast version v6.6.2r5. All scans were produced in RGB and stored in .tif 
format. CIELab transformations were performed using Adobe Photoshop CC 2019.
